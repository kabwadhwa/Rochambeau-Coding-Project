Rock Paper Scissors or Rochambeau is normally a hand game played between two people where each player forms one of rock, paper, or scissor with their hand and wins or loses depending on what the other person chooses. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same option, the result is a tie.

I decided to make a simple version of this game that allows the user to play up to as many wins as they want. 

# Creating rock, paper, scissor game with aspect of randomness
  - User-friendly rock paper scissor game made using python and modules within python. 
  - Imported "random" module from python to access packages to help program implement randomness.
  - Imported "sys" module

## Making it so that the program runs as many times as the user would like
  - Allows user to input the number of rounds
  - Keep track of the score and make sure that the score impacts the results and output of the game.

## Include steps for how to use program
  - User should run the program at the command line. (python rochambeau.py)
  - Allows user to input the number of wins that they want to play up to.
  - Allows user to input their name.
  - User enters their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
  - If an invalid choice is selected, a message will be displayed letting users know that an error happened and that they should try again.
  - The score of the game is displayed after each round and users can play until the user or CPU reaches the amount of wins that the user input in the beginning of the game.
  - At the end of the game, results of the game can be saved for later analysis.
